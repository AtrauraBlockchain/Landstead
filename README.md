# LANDSTEAD #
## Land And Immovable Property Ownership Register ##

The goal of the project is to implement a Proof of Concept (POC) of an ownership register or cadastral system to prove the viability and usability of blockchain technology for such a system in real life situations. The system will be based on unique identifications and immutable registrations on the blockchain
